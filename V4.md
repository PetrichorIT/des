# DES Version 4 Draft

Version 4 includes internal restructuring of most relevent structures in the
net module. This changes include:

-   ModuleCore is no longer existent (expecially not part of the real module)

    -   ModuleContext is a static variable (non-pub) that contains:
        -   id (internal)
        -   path
        -   gates (descriptors only)
        -   metrics (module specific metrics like 'elapsed')
        -   parent (ptrs to both the dyn Module and the relevant context)
        -   children (ptrs to both the dyn Module and the relevant context)
        -   ??? self_ref ???
        -   SimContext
    -   This ModuleContext is provided via an Arc (unmutable but some internal values are celled)
    -   This ModuleContext makes the following functions standalone global:
        -   id, path
        -   str, name
        -   gates / gates_mut / gate / gate_mut, ...
        -   child, parent
        -   ??? is / self_as ???
    -   BufferContext is a permantent static variable (non-pub) that contains:
        -   loopback_buffer (for schedule_at)
        -   output_buffer (for send)
        -   globals (only a ref, not an access param)
    -   Since those are global statics (thread_local) the following operations will
        become standalone functions instead of methods of dyn Module
        -   send
        -   send_in / send_at
        -   schedule_in / schedule_at
        -   shutdown
        -   par / pars
        -   globals
    -   The buffer context must be reset after each event (trivial)

-   Since the ModuleContext is swaped out depending on the module that is active,
    a list of all module contextes must be provided.
    This can be trivialy archived, since ModuleContext is always wrapped in an Arc.
    Modules will be dropped once the cannot be used anymore. However channels and Gates
    should only have weak refs. The strongs refs should allways be in the events themselfs
    or in the inheritance trees.

-   Hooks:

    -   Hooks are handle_message callback that may consume the message
    -   Hooks may contains persitent, module specifc state.
    -   Hooks themselfs do NOT use &mut self of the module which uses them
    -   implement hooks as Vec<dyn Hook> as part of the ModuleContext
    -   hooks can be created using a static fn bound to ModuleContext

    -   Hooks are structs implementing the trait Hook.
    -   Provide a macro to generate hooks from fn

-   Only provide Message not Packet

    -   Header and the like will be part of the message header from now on

-   Gates are provided using the [Gate] struct. This struct is a descriptor containing only
    gate name, pos, size and typ.

    -   Gates do posses a Arc<dyn Module> and an Arc<ModuleContext> to link to the owner
    -   generally this is compacted into a ModuleRef
    -   Gates do possess an Arc<Channel>, note whoever that the channel uses cells to mask its mutable parts

-   If a message arrives:
    -   The event provides: Arc<dyn Module>, Arc<ModuleContext>, Message (with metadata attched)
    -   (0) Ensure the BufferContext is cleared
    -   (1) Set the ModuleContext
    -   (2) use the ModuleContext, to test the Hooks
        -   (2a) A Hook succeeds => break (Hook can use static fn like send since they are provided by the buffer context)
        -   (2b) No Hook succeeds => continue
    -   (3) Invoke handle_message on the Arc<dyn Module>

# Open Questions

-   Arc<dyn Module> does not provide &mut self
-   Use Arc<Mutex<dyn Module>> and then Deref or use RefCell
