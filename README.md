# DES - Discrete event simulator

DES is a discrete event simulator inspired by OMNet++, written in Rust.
Accordingly it can (in the future) be used to simulate networks using convient tools
like custom description languages, automatic memory controll and a strongly abstracted
programming interface.

## IDEAS

- configurable message T for custom base messages
- static <T> with type erased holder for agnostic api
- baseloader contents as sim builder parameter
